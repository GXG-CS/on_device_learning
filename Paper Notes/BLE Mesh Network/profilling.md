# Node Capability Profilling


1. Initialize BLE Mesh Network.
2. Broadcast profiling request to all nodes.
3. Collect responses from each node containing:
   - Node ID
   - CPU speed
   - Number of cores
   - Available RAM
   - Storage capacity
   - Battery capacity
   - Signal strength
   - Communication range
   - Bandwidth
4. Store the collected data in a central profiling database.

# Role Assignment

1. For each node in the profiling database:
   a. If CPU speed and RAM are below thresholds:
      Assign role as Sensor Node.
   b. If CPU speed and RAM are above thresholds and battery capacity is adequate:
      Assign role as Processing Node.
   c. If RAM and battery capacity are high:
      Assign role as Aggregation Node.
   d. If signal strength and communication range are high:
      Assign role as Relay Node.
2. Update node roles in the profiling database.


# Network Architecture Design
1. Initialize network architecture.
2. Group nodes into clusters:
   a. Use proximity data to form clusters.
   b. Ensure each cluster has at least one Processing Node and one Aggregation Node.
3. Establish communication paths:
   a. Connect Sensor Nodes to nearest Processing Nodes.
   b. Connect Processing Nodes to Aggregation Nodes.
   c. Use Relay Nodes to bridge distant nodes and clusters.
4. Implement redundancy:
   a. Add backup paths for critical communication links.
5. Finalize and store network architecture.
