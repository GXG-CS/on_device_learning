### Theoretical Framework for Decentralized BLE Mesh Network

#### 1. Network Topology and Graph Theory

**Graph Representation**:
- Represent the BLE mesh network as a graph \( G = (V, E) \), where \( V \) is the set of nodes (MCUs) and \( E \) is the set of edges (communication links).

**Degree of a Node**:
- The degree \( d(v) \) of a node \( v \) is the number of edges connected to \( v \). For a mesh network, we aim to optimize node degrees for balanced communication.

**Adjacency Matrix**:
- The adjacency matrix \( A \) of graph \( G \) is an \( |V| \times |V| \) matrix where \( A_{ij} = 1 \) if there is an edge between nodes \( i \) and \( j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise.

#### 2. Distributed Learning and Consensus Algorithms

**Distributed Learning Model**:
- Consider a distributed learning scenario where each node \( i \) holds a local dataset \( D_i \). The goal is to collaboratively train a global model \( \theta \).

**Federated Learning Objective**:
- The global objective is to minimize the loss function:
  \[
  \min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|D_i|}{|D|} \mathcal{L}_i(\theta)
  \]
  where \( \mathcal{L}_i(\theta) \) is the local loss function at node \( i \), \( |D_i| \) is the size of the local dataset, and \( |D| \) is the total dataset size.

**Consensus Algorithm**:
- Use consensus algorithms like Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) or Federated Averaging (FedAvg) to update the global model.

  **Distributed Gradient Descent**:
  \[
  \theta^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|D_i|}{|D|} \nabla \mathcal{L}_i(\theta^t)
  \]
  where \( \eta \) is the learning rate.

  **Federated Averaging**:
  \[
  \theta^{t+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|D_i|}{|D|} \theta_i^t
  \]
  where \( \theta_i^t \) is the local model at node \( i \) after local updates.

#### 3. Communication Model

**Managed Flooding**:
- Managed flooding is used for message dissemination. The probability \( P_f \) that a node forwards a message is based on its degree and network conditions.

**Probability of Forwarding**:
\[
P_f(v) = \min\left(1, \frac{C}{d(v)}\right)
\]
where \( C \) is a constant determining the forwarding probability threshold.

**Message Latency**:
- The expected latency \( L \) for a message to propagate through the network can be modeled as:
\[
L = \frac{H \cdot T}{P_f}
\]
where \( H \) is the average number of hops and \( T \) is the transmission time per hop.

#### 4. Energy Consumption Model

**Energy Consumption per Node**:
- The energy consumption \( E(v) \) for a node \( v \) includes transmission, reception, and computation costs:
\[
E(v) = E_{tx}(v) + E_{rx}(v) + E_{comp}(v)
\]

**Transmission and Reception Energy**:
- \( E_{tx}(v) = P_{tx} \cdot T_{tx} \)
- \( E_{rx}(v) = P_{rx} \cdot T_{rx} \)
  where \( P_{tx} \) and \( P_{rx} \) are the power consumption for transmission and reception, and \( T_{tx} \) and \( T_{rx} \) are the corresponding times.

**Computation Energy**:
- \( E_{comp}(v) \) depends on the complexity of the local ML/DL model and the number of computations.

#### 5. Optimization Problems

**Network Lifetime Optimization**:
- Maximize the network lifetime by balancing the energy consumption across nodes:
\[
\max_{\{P_f(v)\}} \min_{v \in V} \frac{E_{initial}(v)}{E(v)}
\]
where \( E_{initial}(v) \) is the initial energy of node \( v \).

**Model Accuracy and Communication Trade-off**:
- Optimize the trade-off between model accuracy and communication overhead:
\[
\min_{\theta, \{P_f(v)\}} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{L}_i(\theta) + \lambda \sum_{v \in V} E_{comm}(v) \right)
\]
where \( \lambda \) is a trade-off parameter.

### Areas for Innovation

1. **Adaptive Topology Management**:
   - Develop adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust the network topology based on node energy levels, communication needs, and environmental conditions.

2. **Lightweight Security Protocols**:
   - Innovate lightweight, energy-efficient cryptographic protocols to enhance security without significantly impacting performance.

3. **Hierarchical Distributed Learning**:
   - Implement hierarchical learning where nodes are grouped into clusters with local aggregators, reducing the communication load and improving scalability.

4. **Predictive Maintenance Using TinyML**:
   - Use TinyML models for predictive maintenance of the network, where nodes can predict potential failures and proactively adjust operations to avoid disruptions.

5. **Energy-Efficient Consensus Mechanisms**:
   - Design consensus mechanisms that minimize energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy and robustness.

6. **Integration with Blockchain**:
   - Explore integrating blockchain technology for secure and transparent model updates and data sharing, ensuring integrity and traceability.
